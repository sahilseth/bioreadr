\title{Question: How To Fix A Bam-Readcount Sm Error: "Couldn'T Grab Single-End Mapping Quality For Read"
This error message has to do with the SM tags on the read which is the single-ended mapping quality. 
https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount/issues/25
Some aligners do not report this so bam-readcount reports this warning when it cannot grab the value. 
It does not invalidate your results and you can safely ignore this error, 
but you should not use the single ended mapping quality field of the output.}
